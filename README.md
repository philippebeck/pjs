## Installation

How to install in 5 steps :

1   Install via Composer : `$ composer require pjs/pjs`  
2   After that, you need to copy inside your project folder the content of the folder : `/vendor/pjs/pjs`  
3   Then, to construct a fonctional database, go to your phpMyAdmin to import the file : `/app/pjs.sql`  
4   And, for Pjs could access to the database, put your phpMyAdmin password in the file : `/app/config.php`  
5   Finally, for front-end dependencies, within your web folder, type in the terminal : `$ npm install`  

If something wrong :
-   Check the config file & your PhpMyAdmin parameters to verify if passwords match  
-   Type in your terminal at the root of the project => `$ composer dump-autoload`  
-   Send an Issue => [https://github.com/philippebeck/pjs/issues](https://github.com/philippebeck/pjs/issues)
